Time Table Scheduing done using [mutation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_(genetic_algorithm)>) and [crossover](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)>) in [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).

## Logic

- SubjectCode, Time Day, Batch (Code not involving genetic algorithm gets some logic and code)
- Subject Code = { 000 Subject1 , .............. 110 Subject7} --- There is no 111
- Time Day = 30 total = ( 00000 Monday First lec. , 11101 Friday Sixth lec. ) Day -> Mon to Fri , Lect -> One to Six. --- There is no 11111 or 11110
- The population cannot be changed
- There should be no 11111111 or 11111110
- If the chromosome generated is same as before the generation cannot be changed
- If the result you want is 01011101 then it would be a stored 101011101 where the first is protective so that the zero doesnt go away or the output is
- 1011101 which would result in bad computation
- uap for represenation of respective maximum can be 5
