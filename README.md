Time Table scheduing done using [mutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_(genetic_algorithm)) and [crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)) in [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) using python.

## Mechanism
The working structure of solving the problem is represented [here](https://github.com/DevilDipan/timetable_geneticalgo/blob/master/info.txt).
